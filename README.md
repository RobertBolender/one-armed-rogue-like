This game was inspired by the birth of my son, and the fact that I can't play games with two hands anymore. I wanted to make a game that could be played with one hand while holding a sleeping infant.

## How to Play

There are only two buttons, which can be activated with "S" and "D" or "Down" and "Right" if playing with a keyboard, or by tapping the two lower corners of the screen if playing on a phone while holding an infant.
